## React Lite - A Reimplementation of React from Scratch
A lightweight re-implementation of React's core ideas including a virtual DOM, a customer renderer, createElement, and a minimal useState/useEffect.

I built this from the ground up to to better understand how React works under the hood. Specifically, I wanted to learn about virtual DOM construction, rendering, and how use effect works(so I stop having infinite rerenders).

### Steps:
1. Start server
`python3 -m http.server 8000`

2. Import my react

Future features:
- [x] refactor react lite to allow use in other modules
- [ ] reconciliation algo
- [ ] clean up after render
- [ ] use ref implementation
- [ ] use memo (?)
- [ ] update this readme
